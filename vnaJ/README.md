## Calibration File
The calibration file included here is for demonstration purposes only. It is strongly advised to to use vnaJ.3.2.2.jar to run your own calibration on your device and replace the file TRAN_miniVNA.cal with your calibration file. The name of the file has to remain TRAN_miniVNA.cal for this to work. Be advised that calibration files of newer releases of vna/J may not work.
