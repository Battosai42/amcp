**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

ampc is an automated measurement tool of crystal parameters using a vector network analyser. 



## Project Description
This Project is intended to automate the measurement of crystals up to about 150MHz using a cheap VNA such as the miniVNA or nanoVNA. The measurement method requires a passive test-fixture according to IEC-444 which is a douple-pi network terminating the crystal at 12.5Ohm.
