**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

ampc is an automated measurement tool of crystal parameters using a vector network analyser. 

![Gui_Example](python3/gui/images/gui_overview.png)

## Project Description
This Project is intended to automate the measurement of crystals up to about 150MHz using a cheap VNA such as the miniVNA or nanoVNA. The measurement method requires a passive test-fixture according to IEC-444 which is a douple-pi network terminating the crystal at 12.5Ohm.

## Feedback
I would be very interessted to hear some feedback from people finding this project interessting, have suggestions or even started using it. Please contact me by mail (git.b42@gmail.com).

## Project Status
The calculation of the motional parameters is still not reliable in all cases and special care has to be taken for the measurement setup. Good calibration of the VNA is essential to get Rs right. Also the impedance matching to the crystal is very important as the calculation of the other motional parameters are relying on a goot match.
