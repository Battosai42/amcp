Automated measurement of crystal parameters using a vector network analyser

WORK IN PROGRESS!

# Project Description
This Project is intended to automate the measurement of crystals up to about 150MHz using a cheap VNA such as the miniVNA or nanoVNA. The measurement methot requires a passive test-fixture according to IEC-444 which is a douple-pi network terminating the crystal at 12.5Ohm.

# Supported Hardware:
- miniVNA tiny 
- nanoVNA (planned)

# Test Fixture
The test-fixture is a double-pi network according to IEC-444. PCB files are created using KiCad 5.0.2
